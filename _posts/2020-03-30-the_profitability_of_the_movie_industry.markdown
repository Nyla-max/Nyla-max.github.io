Since the 1890s, the film industry has provided a gateway to learning, communion and exploration. With the advancement of technology, the film industry has changed specifically the monetary input to create these masterpieces. A successful file requires a successful a team of writers, cinematographers, editors etc. For my first project, I decided to answer the question: What cost makes a successful movie?


Through my exploration of the data, I separated my data into two focus groups: 

    Focus group 1: Movies with a domestic and worldwide gross
    Focus group 2: Movies without a domestic and worldwide gross

I thought this was important to separate in order to compare the budgets to those whom gained revenue and those whom did not. The first focus group showed a large dataset of 5234 movies while the second focus group showed 367 movies. Based on this information, there were more movies with a form of revenue than those without any earned. Since the technological advancements that have occurred rapidly within the movie industry, I decided to focus on last 5 years to gather an accurate picture of the industry today.

Based on my exploration, worldwide gross was substantial higher than production budgets. However, there is a small margin between production budgets and domestic gross. This can suggest within the United States there is a decrease in movie-goers or other outside factors effecting these numbers. The largest average budget in focus group 1 was approximately 100 million dollars while the lowest average budget was approximately 16 million dollars. Talk about LARGE NUMBERS!

In focus group 2, the largest average budget was approximately 100 million dollars and the lowest average budget was approximately 2 million dollars.  As the time passed, the budgets increased however, the revenue did not.

My recommendation is to purse a business venture into the movie industry is good venture to pursue. The movie industry is a lucrative business even though our world is increasing toward virtual original content. Film award shows and festivals are held every year around global even as streaming sites become popular they still require films from the theatre to keep their memberships. There are also opportunities to partner with a streaming service in the future. I am a huge movie fan and acutally enjoying going to the movies to watch a featured film. As a movie-goer, I understand the factors that can effect individuals from attending movies theater such as high priced food and tickets. 

I hope to never see the movie theater go however, if it does have there is no need to stop creating amazing and inspiring content for the world!
